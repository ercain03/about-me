    <h2 class="headers">Bio:</h2>
    <p class="par-bio">Tre was born in the thriving community of Los Angeles, California.  As a child he played baseball and basketball but was never tall enough to take his talents to the next level.  So like any other height challenged individual he got really into computer and console video games.  For a minute electronics were his life and programming peaked his interest.  As years progressed and relationships haulted progress, he is now back at it in full effect and hungry to learn.</p>
